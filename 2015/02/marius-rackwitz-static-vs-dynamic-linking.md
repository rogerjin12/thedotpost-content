Title: Static vs. Dynamic Linking
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Frontend
Summary: Since iOS 8, dynamic linking is also available on Apple’s mobile platform. Before the release, we had only static libraries and frameworks as options to include third-party dependencies in applications. The new opportunities offer some advantages, but have also minor drawbacks inherent.
