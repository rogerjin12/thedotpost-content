When people came to Objective-C and complained about the patterns and syntax we were able to mine more than two decades of experience to explain why we chose to write the code that way.

Swift is a new language and we don't have the experience and common culture in the language to know the idiomatic way to write our Swift code.

We need to work together to bring the best ideas from O-O, Functional, Generic and other paradigms to get the most out of this evolving language.
