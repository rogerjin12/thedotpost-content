Title: Practical Functional Programming in Swift
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Frontend
Summary: Usually, functional programming is taught by abstract functional techniques. Instead this talk goes for a different approach showing examples of unfunctional, imperative code people may have written in the past and how that can be improved with a functional style to write clearer, declarative and testable code.
