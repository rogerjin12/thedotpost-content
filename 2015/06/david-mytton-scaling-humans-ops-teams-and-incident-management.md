Title: Scaling Humans - Ops teams and incident management
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Backend
Summary: 100% uptime is impossible. Modern architectures are designed around failure but what does that mean for the human aspect of incident management? David's talk considers how to prepare for outages, how to structure the response, and how those experiences and techniques differ for small and large companies.
