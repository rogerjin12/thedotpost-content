Title: The expanding boundaries of CSS
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Frontend
Summary: CSS was designed with boundaries in place to make it simple and accessible to “non-programmers”. Those boundaries have benefits as well as drawbacks that affect us in technical and non-technical ways. Recent developments in web tooling and technologies are expanding the boundaries of CSS -- hopefully for the better.
