Johannes walks us through the steps you need to take starting with a REST-API (example Spring Boot) to the Swagger-specification, then calling Swagger-Codegen to generate the client SDK.

The results are: the generated Javascript model, code completion for the model classes (including JSDoc support) in Javascript and in HTML and code completion for the REST API operations.
