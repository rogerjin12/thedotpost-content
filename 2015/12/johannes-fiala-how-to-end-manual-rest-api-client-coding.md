Title: How to end manual REST-API client coding
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Frontend
Summary: This talk shows how you can easily generate Javascript client code SDKs to use for calling your REST API. It walks through the steps you need to take starting with a REST-API (example Spring Boot) to the Swagger-specification, then calling Swagger-Codegen to generate the client SDK. The results are: the generated Javascript model, code completion for the model classes (including JSDoc support) in Javascript and in HTML and code completion for the REST API operations.
