Title: Editing Images in CSS
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Frontend
Summary: CSS is a surprisingly powerful image manipulation tool. This talk explores three CSS features: filters, blend modes, and gradients both individually and in combination to create image effects. With a few lines of CSS, you too can create reusable, unifying filters for your web projects without needing to open an external program.
