Title: Modern Asynchronous JavaScript
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Frontend
Summary: JS is async by nature, and that can lead to uneasy code patterns, but we’ve come a long way since Callback Hell. From Async.js to promises to generators to async/await, and a wink at Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), this talk makes a strong case for clean, readable JS code… still fully async.
