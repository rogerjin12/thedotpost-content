Title: A Tour of the Bleve
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Backend
Summary: Nearly two years ago we set out to build Bleve, an open-source full-text search library for Go.Since then we've worked hard to build not just the code, but also the community around the project.  We'll start with a brief introduction to the capabilities of the library. Then we'll take a tour of the unique ways the community has shaped the project. These vignettes will guide our technical dive into select parts of the Bleve project.
