Curator: sylvinus, davecheney
Category: Backend
Summary: Go has well-known downsides, but Go programmers know that they enable higher-order virtues. Microservices also come at huge costs, but enable similar higher-order benefits. Taken together, microservices and Go form a virtuous cycle, boosting developer confidence and happiness.
