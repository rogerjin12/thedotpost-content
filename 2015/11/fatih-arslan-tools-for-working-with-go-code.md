Curator: sylvinus
Category: Backend
Summary: Fatih highlights some of the best and most used tools and shows how to use from an editor. Go was designed from the beginning to make tools easy to write. This caused the Go ecosystem to have dozens of well built tools, such as formatters, refactoring tools, code generators, navigators, and so on.
