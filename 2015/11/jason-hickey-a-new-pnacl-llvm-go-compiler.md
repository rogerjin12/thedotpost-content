Title: A new PNaCl/LLVM Go Compiler
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Backend
Summary: We present a new compiler to compile programs written in the Go language to the Portable Native Client (PNaCl) sandbox, based on LLVM. This is part of an effort to support distributed development environments, where programs can be run, developed, and debugged everywhere and anywhere.
