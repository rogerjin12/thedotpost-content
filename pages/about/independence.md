<p><strong>Independence</strong> and transparence are essential to build trust with our readers.</p>
<p>We have no one to report to but our audience and we have done everything we can to keep money out of the equation, from keeping costs low to refusing ads or sponsored content.</p>
<p>Our only income comes from our <a href="/conferences">conferences</a> and by making it easy to fork us, we are making sure it will stay this way.</p>
