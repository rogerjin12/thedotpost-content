Title: How to write an article
Slug: about/writing


<h2>Choosing a topic</h2>
<p>Our goal is to feature only technical content targeted to intermediate/expert developers. This means we won't accept things like startup news.</p>

<h2>Writing guidelines</h2>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com/wiki/Writing-Tips">HTML5Rocks writing tips</a> for a good set of guidelines we try to follow. Refer to <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">The Elements of Style</a> for further best practices in English.</p>

<h2>Writing a draft</h2>
<p>You can submit a Pull Request on <a href="https://github.com/thedotpost/thedotpost-content">our repository</a> to add an article in Markdown format. Check the other articles to have examples on the metadata on top of each file.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also send us a draft in Markdown <a href="mailto:contact@thedotpost.com">by email</a> and we will create the Pull Request for you.</p>

<h2>Technical review</h2>
<p>Depending on your history with <em>The dot Post</em>, your article may need to be reviewed for form &amp; quality by a group of technical reviewers. There must be at least one reviewer that is considered independent from the author (for instance he cannot work in the same company).</p>

<h2>Publishing</h2>
<p>Once the reviewers and editors greenlight an article, its Pull Request is accepted and it is published shortly afterwards and announced to the world on our communication channels. You should also try to relay it where you can to increase its reach!</p>
