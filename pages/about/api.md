<h2>GitHub repository</h2>
<p>All our articles are available on Markdown on our <a href="https://github.com/thedotpost/thedotpost-content">GitHub repository</a>. Feel free to fork it! We use <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a> to rebuild <em>The dot Post</em> as a static website so you might want to experiment with it too!</p>

<h2>JSON &amp; Markdown URLs</h2>
<p>All the articles can be fetched in JSON or Markdown form, if you append ".json" or ".md" at the end of their URLs.</p>

<h2>REST API</h2>
<p>We think access to our content is pretty easy with all of the above but we might add a REST API with advanced search features if there is demand for such a thing. Send us your feature requests!</p>
