Writing small programs is just as much fun as writing big ones! Go's standard packages and goroutines make writing small programs that would previously have been done in a scripting language easy and fast, and with interfaces they can be generalized and made more powerful with ease.

This talk looks at a small, real program I was asked to write and how Go won out over languages like Perl and Python, and how interfaces turned it into a general purpose program.
