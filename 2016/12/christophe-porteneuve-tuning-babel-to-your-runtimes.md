Title: Tuning Babel to your runtimes
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Backend
Summary: Babel is amazing, and we all use it to get the latest language goodies now, but we tend to use an all-or-nothing, sledgehammer approach to it. In this talk Christophe shows how to tweak your Babel settings to tailor its level of code transformation to the native support your runtimes offer.
