When Bertrand started using JavaScript the tooling was mostly inexistent. It was hard to find tools to help you being more productive so he started to use vim. He selected a plugin manager, tested and configured plugins, added some dynamic configuration, etc. 
Then it became a shared configuration, a rep on Github. Then came users and contributors. Bertrand realized that he has done the hard work, what others were looking for: more than a configuration a Vim distribution: [http://webvim.org](http://webvim.org)
