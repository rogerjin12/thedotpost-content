Summary: What’s your IDE? Bertrand's is WebVim, a vim-based distribution for JavaScript and Web development. It features everything you’d expect from a modern code editor. And by the way, it runs in a terminal.

When Bertrand started using JavaScript the tooling was mostly inexistent. It was hard to find tools to help you being more productive so he started to use vim. He selected a plugin manager, tested and configured plugins, added some dynamic configuration, etc.

Then it became a shared configuration, a repo on Github. Then came users and contributors. Bertrand realized that he has done the hard work, what others were looking for: more than a configuration, a Vim distribution: [http://webvim.org](http://webvim.org)
