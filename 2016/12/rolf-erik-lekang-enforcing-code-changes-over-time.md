Title: Enforcing code changes over time
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Backend
Summary: We learn new stuff when we work on our projects. Let us use linters together with version control to enforce the changes we want to see in our code base. However, at times it might be too much work to change the configuration of our linters. Rolf Erik proposes a way to make that easier so that we can make sure we utilise what we learn.
