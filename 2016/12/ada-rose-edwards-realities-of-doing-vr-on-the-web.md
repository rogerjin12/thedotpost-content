The goal of this talk is to get developers thinking about how VR is going to impact the web and how they can do VR in a web-like way.

There was a large shift when the mobile web came around. It was largely unexpected so the patterns for working in the mobile web took a long time to become established. The next big shift is coming in the form of Virtual Reality headsets. Like all platforms, the web has come to VR.

After all the web is unquestionably the largest content delivery system in the world, so there is no reason why it should not become the defacto platform for delivering media content in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality.

WebGL and WebVR allow us to build interactive experiences right now. If we start developing using these technologies we can work out what works and what does not when delivering VR content in the web.

By feeding back into Standards we can make VR in the world wide web one which works for everyone, which anyone can easily produce content for, is robust and lasts long in to the future to work on devices we donâ€™t even know yet.
