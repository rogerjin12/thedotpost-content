Title: Pattern libraries through trial and error
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Frontend
Summary: This story sums up Varya's experience in developing modular web solutions and pattern libraries. In fact, she's now doing exactly the same as what she was doing 8 years ago. But how she does it is very different from how she did it back then. And the reasoning of choices for methods and tools to apply goes directly from grasping human nature, no less. BEM, living style guides and visual regression tests are involved.
