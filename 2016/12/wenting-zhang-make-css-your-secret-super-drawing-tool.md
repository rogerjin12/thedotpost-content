Title: Make CSS your secret super drawing tool
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Frontend
Summary: As we all know, everything rendered out of CSS is in a box model. That is why not many people are as enthusiastic as Wenting is about using CSS to draw, since everything has to be some sort of rectangles. In this talk, Wenting works inside of the box and transforms a single div to this mustache icon, all this live!
