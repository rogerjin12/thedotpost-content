Title: Do not fear first class functions
Curator: sylvinus
Category: backend
Summary: First class functions, sometimes known as anonymous functions or closures, are a powerful concept that let Go programmers pass around behaviour to be executed, rather than data to be interpreted. In this presentation Dave explains what first class functions are, shows how to use them, and concludes with an observation that first class functions are something that all Go programmers can become comfortable using with just a little practice.
