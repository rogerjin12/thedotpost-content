Title: The Scandalous Story of the Dreadful Code Written by the Best of Us
Curator: sylvinus
Category: backend
Summary: There are overlooked corners of our codebases. Ignored, unloved. Unimportant. Or so we thought. What was once inconsequential has—somehow—grown into ghastly mess. It's nobody's fault, and yet it's our responsibility. Katrina tells the story of one such mess, and the taming of it.
