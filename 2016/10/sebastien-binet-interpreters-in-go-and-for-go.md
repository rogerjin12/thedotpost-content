Title: Interpreters in Go and for Go
Curator: sylvinus
Category: backend
Summary: Go is a great general purpose programming language and it is thus no surprise it can be a great fit for science work. But Go could be an even better fit for all kind of exploratory work, such as data analysis, if it had an interactive interpreter, also known as a Read-Eval-Print Loop (a REPL). pygo is a tiny, very first step in that direction.
