Title: Go's execution tracer
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Backend
Summary: Go's tools can help you diagnose problems with your applicationsâ€”if you can wield them effectively. The Execution Tracer provides great visibility into the scheduler, to help solve timing dependent bugs and track down latency problems. Rhys argues you should learn how to use the tools before you have a time-critical need.
