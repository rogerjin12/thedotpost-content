Title: Prototype your design!
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Backend
Summary: Prototyping remains an underappreciated technique in software design. In this talk, Robert develops a functioning prototype for a specific Go language extension, multi-dimensional index expressions. He explains how implementing and playing with the prototype informs the existing design, which ultimately may lead to a better final design.
