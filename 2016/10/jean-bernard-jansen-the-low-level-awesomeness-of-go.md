The Go language uses advanced programming techniques from the low-level world to lift that weight from the developer’s shoulders. Some people from the Go team  also are authors of the Plan 9 operating systems, which might partly explain why Go goes really low-level under the hood and why a lot of its magic comes from quite a bunch of assembly code. Jean-Bernard sheds some light onto this part of the language quite unknown from the developers.
