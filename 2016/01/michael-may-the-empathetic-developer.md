Summary: At some point in most of our software engineering careers, we will end up working on code we will think of as legacy - be it objective-c, code without tests or 1.x Swift. Is it okay to be angry, to blame those who came before, to resent the names in the git blame...

<strong>At some point in most of our software engineering careers, we will end up working on code we will think of as legacy.</strong>
<br/><br/>
For those of us working in Swift, it may seem less likely right now, but between the breaking changes in releases and the huge amount of Objective-C in the world, there is plenty of reason to expect it. Even if we are on a completely greenfield project, unless you are writing tests you may recall that Michael Feathers 'legacy code is code without tests' would make that legacy code from day one.
<br/><br/>
So what do we do when we are faced with this? Is it okay to be angry, to blame those who came before, to resent the names in the git blame...
