Title: Swift [and the] Evolution
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Frontend
Summary: The open source release of swift was much more than we might have hoped for. One of the most interesting points is exactly how open the process of shaping swift is. This level of dialogue is new to the Apple community and, though it is easy to overlook, new to Apple as well. I'll discuss the stated goals of the swift upcoming 2.2, 3.0 releases, what will not be in those releases and how we can take this information to foster the most fruitful discussion.
