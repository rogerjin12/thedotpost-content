Title: Distributed Transactions in CockroachDB
Curator: sylvinus
Category: Backend
Summary: In this highly technical talk, Spencer explores CockroachDB's distributed transaction model, starting with a tour of the high level architecture of a cluster, from nodes to gateways to stores to ranges to replication. Then he takes a deep dive into the transaction model, including the common concurrency anomalies. He ends up with a complete exploration of how CockroachDB's two isolation levels (snapshot and serializable) deal differently with the write skew concurrency anomaly.
