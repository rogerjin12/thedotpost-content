Title: Multiple Dispatch
Author: rauschma
Summary: JavaScript has "single method dispatch" â€“ if a method has several implementations (is polymorphic), then a single value determines which of those implementations is chosen when the method is invoked. In this talk, we look at a generalization of single dispatch, "multiple dispatch".
